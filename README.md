# War_Card_Game
A demonstrational repo containing a JavaScript program that will play a game of War with itself. Created as a submission for Week 6 of Promineo Tech's front end bootcamp
This game will run itself when the program is executed.
To view the game and its results, make sure you open dev tools and look at the console.
There is a super special message if your game ends in a tie!


In the future, I may try to further expand on this repository by making a functional game of war that can take multiple players and execute more advanced functions when two players draw a tie.
